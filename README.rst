Exposing the Google Voice "API" to the Python language
-------------------------------------------------------

Google Voice for Python Allows you to place calls, send sms, download voicemail, and check the various folders of your Google Voice Accounts.
You can use the Python API or command line script to schedule calls, check for new recieved calls/sms, or even sync your recorded voicemails/calls.  
Works for Python 2 and Python 3

Full documentation is available up at http://sphinxdoc.github.com/pygooglevoice/

CURRENT STATUS: 

The two-step auth is broken, and appears to need rewriting, in light of the major new version of GVoice.

** I invite everyone who is using this software and enjoying my recent bug fixes and feature additions, to visit my gofundme page, where anyone who is interested in supporting my serious efforts to fix and develop this software further, can make a contribution to help cover my running costs.

Thank you to everyone who will support. It's because of you that I can do this and make this software work again!
